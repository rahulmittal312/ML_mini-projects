The Sonar Dataset involves the prediction of whether or not an object is a mine or a rock given the strength of sonar returns at different angles.

It is a binary (2 class) classification problem. The number of observations for each class is not balanced. There are 208 observations with 60 input variables and 1 output variable. The variable names are as follows:

1.Sonar returns at different angles
2
3..Class (M for mine and R for rock)
