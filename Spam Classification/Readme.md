In this project I have used NLP with two Classification models
1. Navie Bayes GaussianNB
2. Random Forest
Dataset contain 5k examples in which some are spams other are not spams means it is a binary classification problem.
First I have used Navie Bayes model and get the accuracy arroud: 87%
Then i used Random Forest and get the accuracy arround 96%
Data source Kaggle
