This data set contains some training and testing data from a remote sensing study by Johnson et al. (2013)
that involved detecting diseased trees in Quickbird imagery. There are few training samples for the 'diseased trees'
class (74) and many for 'other land cover' class (4265). 
I got 97 % accuracy on cross validation set and 87.75 on test set!
